KARK: Skill & Spark
Where Every Talent Ignites

💡 Idea Summary
SKARK transforms skill-sharing into an engaging, personalized experience through AI-powered matchmaking, gamified Skillpoints, and a vibrant community-driven progress feed. Users swipe to connect based on shared or complementary skills—from coding to cooking to music—and learn through tailored one-to-one personal chats or video calls. A Twitter-style feed fosters collaboration by enabling users to share updates and resources. Trust is built with a peer-driven rating system, unlocking "Expert" status and leaderboard recognition. SKARK makes skill acquisition fun, intuitive, and community-centric.
